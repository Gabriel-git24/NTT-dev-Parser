# About NTT Parser
This project provides a Python-based parser for extracting and analyzing key data from HTML files generated by the Nutrient Tracking Tool (NTT). It uses the **BeautifulSoup library** to parse HTML content, specifically targeting sections like results, precipitation, crop codes, and other related metrics.

## Features
* HTML Parsing: Extracts key elements from HTML files using BeautifulSoup.
* Data Transformation: Converts the parsed data into dictionary format using regex patterns.
* Comparison: Highlights differences between two data sets (TFT vs. NTFT).
* Excel Export: Saves the processed data into Excel files for easy access and further analysis.
* Streamlined Workflow: Handles file uploads in Google Colab for user-friendly integration and processing.

## How to Use
1. Upload the required NTT HTML files using the file upload interface in Google Colab.
2. Run the provided extraction functions:
3. extract_html_tft() for the primary HTML file.
4. extract_html_ntft() for secondary files.
5. View or process the extracted data as needed.
